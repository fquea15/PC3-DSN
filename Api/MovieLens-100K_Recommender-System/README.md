# MovieLens-100K_Recommender-System

This code gives a brief understanding of how to use the surprise library for RecSys. Dataset used is MovieLens-100k.

MovieLens-100K : This data set consists of:

   -100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies. 
	
   -Each user has rated at least 20 movies.

The flow of the project is:

1-EDA

2-Model Selection

3-Tuning algorithm parameters

4-Training and Testing the model

5-Analysis on the predictions

6-K Recommendations

  - Finding the threshold value using the F1 score
  
  - Finding the optimal value for K using precision and recall
  
7-Recommendations to users

8-Comparing predictions with the user's history.
